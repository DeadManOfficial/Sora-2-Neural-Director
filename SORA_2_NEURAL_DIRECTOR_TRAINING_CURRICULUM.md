## TRAINING PHILOSOPHY

This is not a "course." This is a **reconditioning program**. We are reprogramming the way you see reality—teaching you to reverse-engineer the physical world into mathematical tokens that an AI can execute with zero-shot perfection.

**Core Principle:** "Describe reality so precisely that mathematics has no choice but to recreate it."
