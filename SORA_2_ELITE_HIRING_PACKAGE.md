## PART VIII: APPLICATION PROTOCOL

### How to Apply

**DO NOT** submit a standard resume. To apply, you must complete the following challenge:

### THE ENTRY CHALLENGE: "The Impossible Render"

**Generate the following video using ANY AI tool:**

**Brief:**
"A transparent glass clock exploding in reverse (time reversal), inside a mirrored room, shot on 70mm IMAX film with shallow depth of field. The clock must reassemble from shattered fragments with physically accurate glass shard trajectories. The room's mirrors must reflect the scene correctly WITHOUT reflecting the camera. Water droplets suspended in mid-air catch the light. Duration: 10 seconds."

**Submit:**
1. The generated video file (MP4, minimum 1080p)
2. The EXACT prompt syntax you used
3. A 500-word technical breakdown explaining:
   - How you handled the reverse physics
   - How you prevented camera reflection in mirrors
   - How you achieved photorealistic glass refraction
   - What failed in your first 3 attempts and how you fixed it

**Submission Deadline:** Rolling (position open until filled)

**Submit to:** neural-director@[company].com

**Subject Line:** "Titan Protocol Application - [Your Name]"
