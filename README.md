## 💡 Key Concepts

### **Neural Cinematics**
The intersection of deep learning systems (neural networks) and cinematic creation. Unlike traditional cinematography, neural cinematics requires understanding both the art of visual storytelling AND the underlying AI architecture.

### **Prompt Engineering as System Design**
Expert-level prompting isn't just writing descriptive text—it's architecting a communication system between human intent and neural networks, requiring knowledge of:
- How language models tokenize and embed text
- How diffusion models interpret latent representations
- How attention mechanisms weight different prompt elements
- How to debug and optimize for consistent quality

### **The $1.2M Standard**

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

From the expert guide:

1. **Vague descriptions** - Be specific about lighting, motion, materials
2. **Ignoring physics** - Unrealistic motion gets rejected by the model
3. **Poor token economy** - Inefficient prompt structure wastes context
4. **Style inconsistency** - Mixing incompatible visual references
5. **No iterative refinement** - First prompt is rarely optimal

**Pro Tip:** Every failed generation is a learning opportunity. Analyze why it failed, adjust your mental model of how Sora 2 works, and refine your approach.
