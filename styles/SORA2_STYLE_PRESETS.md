Rule-breaking acceptable if capturing moment
Subject clarity over aesthetic beauty
Environmental context important
Organic imperfect framing
Real-world constraints visible
```

**Atmosphere:**
```
Weather: Whatever exists during shooting (don't wait for perfect)

## Complete Minimalist Template

```
MINIMALIST/CLEAN PRESET FULL TEMPLATE:

Photorealistic minimalist aesthetic [SUBJECT] in [CLEAN ENVIRONMENT].
Monochrome or minimal color palette - [White #FFFFFF background / Black
#000000 void / Single accent color specified]. Subject occupies 10-30% of
frame, negative space dominant.

LIGHTING: [High-key even: Shadowless wrap-around 2:1 contrast / Dramatic
single source: Geometric shadow control]. Clean controlled illumination,
every shadow intentional, no accidental elements. Background separately lit
for pure [white/black/color] field.

COMPOSITION: [Geometric precision / Rule of thirds asymmetry / Centered
symmetry]. Minimal elements, what's absent matters as much as present.
Subject isolated through [negative space / color contrast / selective focus].
No visual clutter.

ENVIRONMENT: [White void studio / Pure black void / Minimal architectural
space]. Clean controlled, no atmospheric particles, no texture unless
intentional. Spacious emptiness as design element.

COLOR: [Monochrome white/black/gray only / Minimal single color family /
Single accent color on neutral]. Desaturation -30% or full monochrome,
precise color control, no muddy mixtures. Backgrounds pure single color.

CAMERA: Locked tripod static composition OR slow precise motion control
movement. No handheld shake, no organic imperfection, geometric intentional
framing. [50-85mm] at [f/5.6-8.0] for controlled depth.

POST: Clean digital aesthetic - no grain, no artifacts, pure precision.
Perfect color control, geometric precision, remove all imperfections. High
contrast black/white OR low contrast subtle grays OR controlled color field.

MOOD: Zen calm, essential reduction, spacious breathing room, geometric
precision, quiet elegance, what remains after everything unnecessary removed.

AVOID: Clutter, atmospheric particles, handheld shake, multiple colors,
textured backgrounds, organic imperfection, complexity, noise.

# GRITTY REALISM PRESET

## Visual Characteristics

**Color Palette:**

Grays/Browns: Urban decay palette
Rust: #B7410E, Concrete #808080, Dirt #654321
Minimal Color: Only motivated sources (traffic lights, signs)
```

**Lighting Setup:**
```
Harsh Reality: Direct sun, overhead fluorescent, mixed sources
High Contrast: 12:1+ with deep shadows and hot spots
Available Light: No beautification, take what exists
Practical: Street lights, neon, headlights
Unflattering: Harsh overhead, shadows under eyes
```

**Camera Approach:**
```
Handheld: Active shake, operator presence visible
Reactive: Following not leading action
Documentary: Observational not staged
Imperfect: Soft focus acceptable, framing errors
```

**Composition:**
```
Gritty street reality not composed beauty
Environmental chaos visible
Tight framing, limited negative space
Dense urban visual information
```

**Atmosphere:**
```
Urban decay, industrial grit
Heat shimmer or cold breath visible
Pollution haze, dust, dirt
Lived-in wear visible everywhere
```

**Post-Production:**
```
Desaturated -30% to -40%
Increased grain 20-25%
Lifted shadows slightly, crushed blacks
Increased midtone contrast +20%
Imperfections preserved (lens flares, dirt, shake)
```

## Complete Gritty Realism Template

```
GRITTY REALISM PRESET FULL TEMPLATE:

Photorealistic gritty realism [SUBJECT] in [URBAN/INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT].
Desaturated -35%, harsh reality palette: rust #B7410E, concrete #808080,
dirt #654321. Documentary unflinching aesthetic.

LIGHTING: Harsh available light - [Direct overhead sun / Fluorescent
industrial / Mixed sodium vapor street lights]. High contrast 14:1 with
deep unflattering shadows and hot spots. No beautification, accept what
exists. Mixed color temperatures 2200K-6500K creating realistic chaos.

COMPOSITION: Gritty documentary framing, tight compositions showing
environmental density. Street reality not aesthetic beauty. Visual chaos and
urban detail visible. Functional framing over composed prettiness.

ENVIRONMENT: [Urban decay / Industrial zone / Working-class neighborhood].
Lived-in wear visible - peeling paint, graffiti, rust, dirt, accumulated
human presence. Heat shimmer from asphalt or cold breath from temperature,
pollution haze creating atmospheric grit.

COLOR: Heavy desaturation -35%, muted reality, rust and concrete grays
dominant. Minimal color only from motivated sources (traffic lights, neon
signs). Skin tones unflattering, slight green institutional cast overall.

CAMERA: Active handheld, shoulder-mount with visible operator shake. Reactive
following action not predictive leading. Documentary observational style.
Occasional soft focus during rapid reframes (authentic imperfection
preserved). Framing errors acceptable if capturing moment.

POST: Gritty grade - desaturate -35%, increase grain 20-25% (16mm film or
digital noise), lift shadows to 15 (crushed black floor), increase midtone
contrast +20%, preserve imperfections (lens flares, dust on lens, camera
shake).

MOOD: Unflinching reality, working-class struggle, urban survival, lived-in
authenticity, beauty in decay, human resilience, no romanticization.

AVOID: Beauty lighting, clean environments, smooth camera work, saturated
colors, glamorization, aesthetic softening, removed imperfections.
